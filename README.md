With this information, a DBMS can be implemented that can store and manage all the necessary data for the real estate office. Tables can be created for each of these categories, and relationships can be established between the tables to allow for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. The DBMS can also include security features to ensure that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access.
